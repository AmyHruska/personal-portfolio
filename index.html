        <p><em>Hello everyone!</em> Welcome to my project portfolio. In this website is a collection of things I've worked on while at Epicodus and <span class="strike">likely</span> <strong>definitely</strong> beyond.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artistic welding</li>
            <li>Wood chopping</li>
            <li>Pizza making</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some background information on myself: I used to work in the tech industry, as a QA tech, from 2006 - 2008. After that I moved onto helping my parents renovate houses & helped identify potential projects. After they retired, I needed a new job and always enjoyed working in software development, which is why I've enrolled at Epicodus.

                        This project was my second attempt at using CSS. Unfortunately I accidently left a stray div element with a class inside of it and, to this day, I haven't gone back and removed it. I kinda like how it might someday show how far I've progressed.
